##Nicole Lemke Notes

In this project I perosnally did the style guide amd home page mock up. I also put together the hamburger menu from scratch with JS. the carousel I used a code pen but looked over the JS from it...https://codepen.io/stephenkarpeles/pen/gejxoY...the hamburger was easier to code in the end then I thought. I used this tutorial as a reference to help me do it: https://dev.to/ljcdev/easy-hamburger-menu-with-js-2do0. I would have liked more time to fix some positioning things but overall I'm happy with my design and my js I created. -Nicole Lemke
