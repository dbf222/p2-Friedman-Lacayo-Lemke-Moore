                           research and conservation group. An international nonprofit 501(c) 3 organization, Sea Turtle Conservancy was founded in 
                           1959 by world-renowned sea turtle expert Dr. Archie Carr to save sea turtles from eminent extinction through rigorous 
                           science-based conservation. Headquartered in Florida, the organization carries out worldwide programs to conserve and recover 
                           sea turtle populations through research, education, advocacy and protection of the natural habitats upon which they depend. 
                           Over the course of nearly 60 years, Sea Turtle Conservancy’s research programs have yielded much of what is now known about 
                           sea turtles and the threats they face, and the organization is applying this knowledge to carry out the world’s most successful 
                           sea turtle protection and recovery programs.
